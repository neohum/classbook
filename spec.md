# spec.md — classbook

Good morning. Jot down what you want today — one idea per bullet, plain words are
fine. Each bullet becomes a task card the agents pick up and build while you teach.
You don't have to be precise; the **lead** agent will tidy and split anything fuzzy.

## Today

<!-- 한 줄에 하나씩 불릿(- )으로 적으세요. 루프가 매 틱마다 이 섹션을 읽어
     자동으로 태스크 카드를 만듭니다(scripts/loop/spec-sync.ts). `- [x]`로
     체크한 줄은 건너뜁니다. 예:
     - Add a "remember me" checkbox to the login screen
     - Fix: the dashboard chart is blank on first load -->

## Backlog (auto-managed)

Leave this for the agents. The loop reads the bullets above and turns each into a
task card in the SQLite backlog (spec-sync), and — when idle — also triages your
chat prompts into cards via a sub-agent (assess-prompts). You'll get a Telegram
message to approve or reject each change before it ships — no need to check here.
